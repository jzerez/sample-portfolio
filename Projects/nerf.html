								<h2>Background</h2>
								<p>Have you ever been watching a movie where the bad guy shoots a bullet, slow motion is engaged, and the camera pans perfectly to keep the bullet in frame, adding to the drama when the good guy dodges the bullet just in the knick of time? Or those millitary videos where the camera pans to follow a bullet or ballistic missle? Something like this:</p>
								<span class="image gallery"><img src="../images/giphy.gif" alt="" /></span>
								<p>I wanted to make something that could do that, so I decided to start working on the Nerf Dart Tracker, which would do the same thing, but for a Nerf dart, and not an actual bullet. This is my first project that utilizes computer vision and extensive PID controls. It is programmed in python, and uses OpenCV, a free computer vision library, to process the frames from the camera.</p>
								<h2>Software</h2>
								<p>The software behind this project is arguably the most interesting part. Using python and OpenCV, and a <em>lot</em> of googling and troubleshooting, I made a python script that can track an object and its trajectory over time. The script takes raw frames from the camera, applies a gaussian blur to the incomming frame, filters it out for a specific range of colors in the HSV colorspace, cleans the resulting image with opening and closing morphology operations, and then detects and records contours and their locations. A bounding box is drawn over the largest contour, and the center of said box is generated. This coordinate represents the position of the nerf dart in two dimensional space. This coordinate will be is published to the serial port of an arduino. The arduino, in turn, will use a PID control algorithm to control servos that can pan and tilt the camera as to keep the nerf dart in the center of the frame. </p>
								<h2>Hardware</h2>
								<p>This is currently the largest roadblock preventing me from finishing this project. Being a somewhat poor college student, buying hardware to actually move the camera is somewhat difficult. Check back for future updates when this project is completed!</p>
