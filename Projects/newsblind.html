								<h2>Design Philosophy</h2>
								<p>NewsBlind is a webapp that is supposed to empower users by presenting them with relevant information about an article before they actually read it. Our webapp does not censoring specific articles, rather it helpings the user to determine the level of skepticism they should have when approaching an article. The desicion to read and believe an article is still made by the user. In addition to this, we took many steps to ensure our webapp would not be polarizing, as fake news can often be. We are very transparent with the factors that go into the final rating of an article, and we output a confidence spectrum rather than a binary "fake or real", which helps to inform the user without comming across as accusatory or hostile, increasing the probability the user will take the advice of the webapp seriously.</p>
								<h2>How it Works</h2>
                <p>Newsblind features quite a few neat features. It includes:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>A machine learning algorithm to initially determine a guess for an article's legitimacy</li>
                  <li>A filter that checks the domain of the inputted article's URL against a known list of fake, or questionable domains</li>
                  <li>A filter that checks the top level domain of the inputted article's URL to check for particularly suspicious (ie .mom) or legitimate ones (ie .gov)</li>
                  <li>A classifier trained by a Naive Bayesian Classifier to detect the clickbait-y-ness of an article's title</li>
                  <li>A filter that checks the grammar of the article</li>
                  <li>A filter that detects the sentiment and polarity of the article's text</li>
                  <li>A web-crawler that can collect the newest articles across the web to make an adaptive training set for the initial machine learning algorithm</li>
                  <li>An algorithm that selectively weights the scores of each factor tested to create a final confidence level</li>
                </ul>
